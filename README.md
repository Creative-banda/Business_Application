# ShopSphere

**ShopSphere** is a mobile app project built using **React Native** and **Express**. This app serves as a platform for discovering and managing local businesses, showcasing essential features such as user authentication, shop searches, and business profile management. The UI design is inspired by a YouTube channel that I found appealing, and I've infused my own creativity into it to develop this app.
